Prompt engineering is the craft of designing inputs for large language models so they produce reliable, useful outputs. Think of prompts as a conversation spec: you set the role, supply context, give clear instructions, and constrain the answer format.

Why it matters

Models respond to what you askâ€”small phrasing changes can dramatically alter results.
Good prompts reduce hallucinations, make outputs deterministic, and cut iteration time.
Core components

Role: tell the model who it should be (e.g., "You are an expert Python tutor").
Goal: state the objective clearly (summarize, translate, refactor, etc.).
Context: supply necessary facts, dataset snippets, or prior messages.                         
How LLMs work

- Tokens and embeddings: Text is split into tokens; each token maps to a numeric embedding the model processes.
- Transformer core: Stacks of self-attention and feed-forward layers let the model learn contextual relationships across tokens.
- Training: Models are first pretrained on large corpora to predict next tokens, then optionally fine-tuned on specialized data.
- Context window: Models only see a fixed-length context; longer contexts require chunking or retrieval-augmented approaches.
- Decoding strategies: Greedy, beam search, and sampling (temperature/top-k/top-p) control how outputs are generated.
- Practical notes: Clear role/context, few-shot examples, and constrained output formats reduce errors and hallucinations.

Python examples

Hugging Face (local or hosted model):
from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")
result = generator(
    "Give a one-sentence summary of how LLMs work:",
    max_length=60,
    do_sample=False
)
print(result[0]["generated_text"].strip())

OpenAI chat-style request (requires openai library and API key):
import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a concise AI assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain in two sentences how large language models work."}
    ],
    temperature=0.3,
    max_tokens=150
)
print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"].strip())

Tips for production
- Validate outputs programmatically (sanity checks, schemas).
- Use temperature=0 (or low) for deterministic results when needed.
- Combine retrieval or tools for up-to-date or factual answers.
